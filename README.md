# CifarGAN-Sample

This project is a simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model that is designed to generate images of objects from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The GAN architecture used in this project is based on the DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN) model.

The model is based on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The dataset can be downloaded from the [official website](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) of the CIFAR-10 dataset.
